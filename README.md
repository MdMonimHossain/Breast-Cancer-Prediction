# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques

### Dataset Description
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set is a widely-used dataset in the field of machine learning and cancer research. It was originally collected by Dr. William H. Wolberg at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison, and was made available to the public 
through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains a collection of features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass samples, along with their corresponding diagnoses. The goal of this dataset is to predict whether a given 
breast mass is benign or malignant based on these features. The dataset is provided in a comma-separated values (CSV) file format. Each row represents a separate sample, and the columns contain the various features and diagnosis. The dataset includes 569 instances, each 
represented by a unique sample ID, diagnosis (categorized as ‘M’ for malignant or ‘B’ for benign), and ten real-valued features. These features include measurements such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and 
fractal dimension. The mean, standard error and “worst” or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius. All 
feature values are recorded with four significant digits. Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant.
